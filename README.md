# Fluidos Energy Assessment

This is a preliminary evaluation of the possible benefits in terms of power consumption when using the FLUIDOS infrastructure.

This innovative approach to edge-to-cloud management and orchestration raises many additional challenges to cope with the dynamicity and heterogeneity of computing devices. Still, it has the potential to bring the same benefits of the cloud to the edge of the network, for example, with respect to power consumption. 

In fact, this work presents a preliminary assessment of the potential energy savings when fluid technology is used. This is achieved by analyzing a real use case in the computing continuum, namely, a university lab that can benefit from the increased flexibility in running user applications on all the available devices. To achieve this goal, two additional minor contributions can be also envisioned: 

1) we introduce a new definition of the performance requirement to describe the application QoE within the heterogeneous devices of the continuum, and 
2) we define a possible methodology that enables the shift from current desktop applications to the fluid containerized environment.
